## How to use Simple Voice Chat

There's two ways you can do this, with fabric or with forge,
if you already use one or the other don't switch. But, if you don't use either I recommend fabric.
(How to install the mod will be at the bottom since it's the same process for both)

### Fabric

- Go to [FabricMC.net](https://fabricmc.net/)
- Click on the "download" tab at the top
- Download the installer
- Run the jar file, it should automatically go to the latest so all you'll have to do is press "install"
- You'll also want to install the [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)
- On the page linked above go to files at the top (it should be right next to the picture)
- Download for the latest version (it should just be the highest)

- Next you'll want to run fabric for the first time just to make sure everything works and to make the files needed
- After you get to the title screen close the game
- Press (Windows Key) + R and in the prompt type "%appdata%" and press enter
- Navigate to ".minecraft", then "mods"
- Drop the Fabric API file from earlier into that folder (mods folder)

### Forge

- Go to [MinecraftForge.net](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/)
- Download the installer 
- Run the installer
- Choose the setting "install client" then press "ok"
- Press ok on the finished tab when it pops up

### Installation

- Download the voice chat mod from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-voice-chat/files)
- Select the installation for whatever launcher and version you're using
- Press (Windows Key) + R and in the prompt type "%appdata%" and press enter
- Navigate to ".minecraft", then "mods"
- Then drag it into the mods folder
- For both clients if the mods folder is not already there you can add it by making a new folder and naming it mods
